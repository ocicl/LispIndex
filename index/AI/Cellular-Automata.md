## cl-ca

**System Name:** `cl-ca`

**Purpose:** Library for implementing cellular automata programs like Conway's Game of Life.

**Why Use It:**
- **Flexible Architecture**: Stores automata in closure-protected hash table with functional interface
- **Programmable Cells**: Each automaton has state and function called each step
- **Neighborhood Functions**: Built-in Moore and Von Neumann neighborhood implementations
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Automaton functions can modify both state and behavior of cells
- **Step-by-Step Control**: Run-step function for controlled simulation advancement
- **2D Coordinate System**: Uses (x . y) cons pairs as spatial keys

**Best For:** Conway's Game of Life implementations, cellular automaton simulations, artificial life experiments, pattern generation, and educational demonstrations of emergence.

**Note:** Includes example programs. Functions: set-automaton, get-automaton, run-step. Well-documented with docstrings.
