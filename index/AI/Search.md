## micmac

**System Name:** `micmac`

**Purpose:** Graph search library and bucket of random bits - alpha-beta, UCT, beam search, MCMC.

**Why Use It:**
- **Game AI**: Game tree search algorithms
- **Alpha-Beta**: Alpha-beta pruning for adversarial search
- **UCT**: Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (Monte Carlo Tree Search)
- **Beam Search**: Heuristic search algorithm
- **MCMC**: Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
- **Game Theory**: Game-theoretic algorithms
- **MGL-PAX**: Well-documented with MGL-PAX
