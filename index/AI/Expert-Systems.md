## babylon

**System Name:** `babylon`

**Purpose:** Modular, configurable, hybrid knowledge engineering systems framework for AI and expert systems development.

**Why Use It:**
- **Multiple Reasoning Paradigms**: Supports frames, rules, Prolog, constraint satisfaction, and freetext processing in a unified framework
- **Configurable Architecture**: Three-tier architecture (basic, mini, normal) allows selecting appropriate functionality levels
- **Historical Significance**: Restored from CMU AI Repository, represents classic AI system design patterns
- **FMCS Integration**: Powered by Flavors Meta-Class System for demonic metaprogramming and flexible knowledge representation
- **Interactive Development**: TTY-based menu system for interactive knowledge base development and testing

**Best For:** Expert system development, knowledge representation research, AI education and historical study, hybrid reasoning applications, and projects requiring multiple inference mechanisms.

**Note:** MIT License. Authors: JÃ¼rgen Walther (original), Colin J.E. Lupton "the Phoeron" (restoration). Depends on FMCS. Tested on SBCL 2.3.4 and LispWorks 8.0.1 on macOS. Includes example configurations and knowledge bases.
