## cl-smt-lib

**System Name:** `cl-smt-lib`

**Purpose:** Common Lisp integration with SMT-LIB solvers.

**Why Use It:**
- **SMT Solver Integration**: Interface to Z3, CVC4, and other SMT solvers
- **Case-Sensitive Reader**: #! reader macro for SMT-LIB forms
- **Process Management**: Launch and communicate with solver processes
- **Lisp Integration**: Read and write SMT-LIB directly from Lisp
- **Debugging Support**: Copy solver I/O to streams for debugging
- **Multiple Solvers**: Works with any SMT-LIB 2.0 compliant solver

**Best For:** Formal verification, theorem proving, constraint solving, program analysis.
