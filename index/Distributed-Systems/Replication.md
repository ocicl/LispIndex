## cl-replica

**System Name:** `cl-replica`

**Purpose:** Hash-table replication via epidemic algorithms for distributed systems.

**Why Use It:**
- **Epidemic Protocol**: Scalable push-update distribution
- **Partial Views**: Works in large unreliable networks
- **Vector Clocks**: Partial ordering for conflict resolution
- **UDP/TCP**: Network communication for updates
- **Standard API**: Similar to standard hash-table functions

**Best For:** Distributed applications, peer-to-peer systems, eventual consistency, large networks.

**Note:** Implements epidemic algorithms for hash-table replication across thousands of nodes.
