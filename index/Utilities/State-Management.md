- **Automatic Updates**: Setting a ref updates all related refs
- **Computed Refs**: Define relationships between ref cells
- **Declarative**: Specify what should happen, not how
- **Bidirectional**: Set computed refs to update source cells

**Best For:** Reactive programming, state management, GUI applications, data binding.
