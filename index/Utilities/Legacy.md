**System Name:** `arnesi`

**Purpose:** Utilities suite (historical/legacy library, mostly superseded).

**Why Use It:**

- **Historical**: Good building block 10+ years ago

**Best For:** Maintaining legacy applications that depend on it, particularly UCW-based web applications.

**Note:** For new projects, use more modern alternatives like Alexandria. Arnesi is primarily maintained for legacy support.
