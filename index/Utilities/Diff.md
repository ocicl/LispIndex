## cl-difflib

**System Name:** `cl-difflib`

**Purpose:** Compute differences between sequence pairs - port of Python's difflib.

**Why Use It:**
- **Unified Diffs**: unified-diff for standard diff output
- **Context Diffs**: context-diff for context-based diffs
- **Sequence Generic**: Works on any sequence (lists, vectors, strings)
- **Similarity Measures**: get-close-matches for fuzzy matching
- **Low-Level Building Blocks**: sequence-matcher, get-opcodes for custom processing
- **Ratcliff-Obershelp**: "Gestalt pattern matching" algorithm (fancier than R-O)
- **Human-Friendly**: Matches "look right" to people

**Best For:** Diff generation, version control tools, similarity detection, fuzzy string matching.

**Note:** MIT license. Transcription of Python difflib. Portable CL. Available via ASDF-INSTALL.
