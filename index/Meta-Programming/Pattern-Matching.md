2 libraries

---

## trivia

**System Name:** `trivia`

**Purpose:** Pattern matching compiler compatible with Optima.

**Why Use It:**
- **Optima Compatible**: Drop-in replacement for Optima
- **Faster**: Runs faster than Optima
- **More Extensible**: Better `defpattern` system
- **Balland2006 Optimizer**: Advanced pattern compilation
- **Many Patterns**: Arrays, hash-tables, structs, classes, guards, etc.
- **FSet Support**: Works with FSet collections
- **Widely Used**: Very popular pattern matching library

**Best For:** Pattern matching in Common Lisp.

**Note:** Successor to Optima with better performance.

## optima

**System Name:** `optima`

**Purpose:** Optimized pattern matching library.

**Why Use It:**
- **Pattern Matching**: Comprehensive pattern matching
- **Optimized**: Uses optimization techniques from FP research
- **Many Patterns**: Constants, variables, guards, constructors, etc.
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new pattern types
- **Derived Patterns**: Define patterns in terms of others
- **Widely Used**: Very popular before Trivia

**Best For:** Pattern matching (though Trivia is now preferred).

**Note:** Trivia is the recommended successor with better performance.
