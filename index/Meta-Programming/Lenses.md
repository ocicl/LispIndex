## fresnel

**System Name:** `fresnel`

**Purpose:** Lenses - lossless, composable bidirectional translations.

**Why Use It:**
- **Lenses**: Bidirectional transformations (get/put in both directions)
- **Program Synthesis**: Used for AST transformation in program synthesis
- **Composable**: Combine lenses for complex transformations
- **DSL Conversion**: Convert between ASTs and simplified DSLs
- **Parser-Like**: Writing lenses feels like writing parsers
- **Automatic Reverse**: Get reverse translation "for free"

**Best For:** Program transformation, AST manipulation, bidirectional data conversion.

**Note:** Not functional lenses/optics - these are bidirectional transformations.
