## cl-form-types

**System Name:** `cl-form-types`

**Purpose:** Determine value types of Common Lisp forms from environment information.

**Why Use It:**
- **Type Inference**: Infer types of forms from environment declarations
- **Static Analysis**: Analyze code for type information
- **Compiler Integration**: Works with CLTL2 environment API
- **Full Coverage**: Supports all special forms except CATCH
- **Macro Expansion**: Fully expands macros and symbol-macros
- **Type Safety**: Enable better type checking in your code

**Best For:** Static analysis tools, type checkers, and compiler optimizations.

**Note:** Requires cl-environments library.

## cl-form-types

**System Name:** `cl-form-types`

**Purpose:** Determine value types of Common Lisp forms from environment information.

**Why Use It:**
- **Type Deduction**: Extract types from declarations, special forms, and function calls
- **Code Walking**: Portable walker handles macros and environments across implementations
- **Extensible**: Add custom type logic via generic function methods

**Best For:** Static analysis, type checking, optimization, compiler development.

**Note:** No explicit license mentioned.

## cl-form-types

**System Name:** `cl-form-types`

**Purpose:** Determine value types of Common Lisp forms from environment.

**Why Use It:**
- **Type Inference**: Infer types from forms and environment
- **Static Analysis**: Analyze code types without evaluation
- **Environment-Aware**: Uses CLTL2 environment information
- **Compiler Support**: Aids in optimization and type checking

**Best For:** Compiler development, code analysis, type inference tools.

**Note:** Requires cl-environments for portability.
