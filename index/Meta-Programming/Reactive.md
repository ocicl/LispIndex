## cells

**System Name:** `cells`

**Purpose:** Spreadsheet-like expressiveness for CLOS with automatic dependency tracking.

**Why Use It:**
- **Reactive Programming**: Automatic propagation of changes through dependency graphs
- **Declarative**: Express relationships declaratively rather than imperatively
- **CLOS Integration**: Works naturally with Common Lisp Object System
- **Formula Cells**: Cells with formulas that automatically recompute
- **Event Propagation**: Changes cascade through dependent cells automatically

**Best For:** Reactive UIs, data flow programming, spreadsheet-like applications, constraint systems.

**Note:** Ports to Clojure/ClojureScript (MatrixCLJS) and Javascript (MatrixJS) available. Limited documentation, test suite available.
