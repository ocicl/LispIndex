## delorean

**System Name:** `delorean`

**Purpose:** Macros for mocking time in tests.

**Why Use It:**
- **Frozen Time**: with-frozen-clock stops time for testing
- **Shifted Time**: with-shifted-clock moves to future/past
- **Scaled Time**: with-scaled-clock speeds up or slows down time
- **Nestable Clocks**: Clock macros can be nested arbitrarily
- **Local-Time Integration**: Works with local-time library

**Best For:** Testing time-dependent code, temporal mocking, unit tests.

**Note:** By cddr. Simple solution for time-based testing scenarios.
