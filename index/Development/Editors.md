## micros

**System Name:** `micros`

**Purpose:** Micro SLIME/Swank implementation forked for Lem editor.

**Why Use It:**
- **Lem Integration**: Designed specifically for Lem editor
- **SLIME Independence**: Avoids SLIME version coupling
- **Stable Interface**: Not subject to SLIME breaking changes
- **Custom Features**: Easier to add Lem-specific features
- **Performance**: Fixes REPL output bottlenecks

**Best For:** Lem editor development, custom SLIME-like tools.

**Note:** Created due to SLIME's tight Emacs coupling and breaking changes.
