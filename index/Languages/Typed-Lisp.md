## coalton

**System Name:** `coalton`

**Purpose:** Efficient, statically typed functional programming language integrated with Common Lisp.

**Why Use It:**
- **Static Typing**: Hindley-Milner type system in Common Lisp
- **Algebraic Data Types**: Full ADT support
- **Type Inference**: Automatic type inference
- **CL Integration**: Directly integrates into Common Lisp
- **Efficient**: Compiles to efficient CL code
- **Pattern Matching**: Comprehensive pattern matching
- **Parametric Polymorphism**: Full polymorphism support

**Best For:** Projects wanting static typing and functional programming within Common Lisp.
