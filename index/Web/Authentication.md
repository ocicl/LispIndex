- **PBKDF2**: Secure password hashing (SHA1/256/512)
- **Role-Based**: User role management
- **Session Management**: Login/logout handling
- **Authorization**: auth macro for protecting routes
- **Flexible**: Non-opinionated, no database coupling
- **MIT Licensed**: Permissive licensing

**Best For:** Web app authentication, Clack applications, role-based access control.

**Note:** Created by Fernando Borretti. Avoids weak hashing like SHA-256 alone.
