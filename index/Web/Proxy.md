## claxy

**System Name:** `claxy`

**Purpose:** Simple proxy middleware for Clack web applications.

**Why Use It:**
- **URL Rewriting**: Proxy requests to different backends based on path prefixes
- **Multiple Backends**: Route different paths to different services
- **Clack Integration**: Simple Lack middleware component
- **Pattern Matching**: Match and replace URL path segments at root level

**Best For:** Microservices architectures, development proxies, API gateways, and routing requests to multiple backend services from single frontend.

**Note:** Apache License 2.0. Simple and unambitious design. Works with Lack middleware system. No complex routing or transformation features.
