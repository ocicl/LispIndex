## gooptest

**System Name:** `gooptest`

**Purpose:** Testing framework for Arduino/AVR embedded systems using simulated hardware.

**Why Use It:**
- **Hardware Simulation**: Test Arduino sketches without physical hardware using simavr emulator
- **Cycle-Accurate Testing**: Control execution at CPU cycle level for precise timing tests
- **Pin State Verification**: Assert and verify pin states (high/low) at specific times
- **Temporal Assertions**: Test timing-dependent behavior with cycle-between for events within time windows
- **Automated Compilation**: Integrates with arduino-cli for automatic sketch compilation
- **Reproducible Tests**: Eliminate hardware flakiness and timing variations in CI/CD

**Best For:** Arduino/AVR firmware testing, embedded systems TDD, hardware-in-the-loop simulation alternatives.
