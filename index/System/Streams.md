**Why Use It:**
- **Gray Streams**: User-defined stream classes and methods
- **Portable**: Works across all major CL implementations
- **Stream Extension**: Create custom stream types
- **Thin Layer**: Minimal compatibility wrapper
- **Standard Interface**: Unified API despite implementation differences
- **Extensions**: Includes stream-file-position, stream-read/write-sequence
- **Well-Adopted**: Used by many libraries

**Best For:** Implementing custom stream types portably.

**Note:** Essential for libraries that define new stream classes.
