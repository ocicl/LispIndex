## changed-stream

**System Name:** `changed-stream`

**Purpose:** Apply changes to a stream without modifying the underlying stream.

**Why Use It:**
- **Non-destructive Edits**: Modify stream content without changing source
- **Composable Changes**: Stack multiple changed-streams for complex transformations
- **Efficient Read-sequence**: Optimized implementation for bulk reads
- **Full Stream Support**: Supports read-char, peek-char, file-position
- **Insert/Delete/Replace**: Flexible modification operations
- **Stream Extension**: Can extend or shrink effective stream length

**Best For:** Stream preprocessing, text transformation, testing stream readers, virtual file modifications.

**Note:** LGPL2 License. Source stream must be at position 0. Read-only, no write operations supported.

## circular-streams

**System Name:** `circular-streams`

**Purpose:** Circularly readable streams that automatically reset to beginning after reaching EOF.

**Why Use It:**
- **Automatic Reset**: Stream position resets to 0 when EOF is reached, enabling continuous reading
- **Gray Streams Implementation**: Uses portable trivial-gray-streams for compatibility
- **Simple Wrapper**: Easy to wrap any existing stream with circular behavior
- **Read-Sequence Support**: Works with both read-char and read-sequence operations
- **Fast I/O**: Built on fast-io library for efficient stream operations

**Best For:** Processing repeating data patterns, testing with finite datasets that need to cycle, and applications requiring continuous data streams without manual repositioning.

**Note:** LLGPL license. Originally written for Clack. Only works with octet streams that support read-byte. Depends on fast-io and trivial-gray-streams.
