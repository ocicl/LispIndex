- **NUMA Optimization**: Control thread placement on NUMA systems
- **Real-Time Systems**: Ensure critical threads run on dedicated cores
- **Benchmarking**: Isolate workloads to specific CPUs for consistent measurements

**Best For:** High-performance computing, real-time systems, performance optimization, parallel processing.

**Note:** Platform-specific. Part of more-cffi utilities. Unix/Linux focused.
