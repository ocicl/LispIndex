## nkeymaps

**System Name:** `nkeymaps`

**Purpose:** General-purpose keymap management system inspired by Emacs.

**Why Use It:**
- **Prefix Keymaps**: Define keymaps with prefix keys (e.g., C-c prefix)
- **Multiple Keyschemes**: Switch between Emacs-style, VI-style bindings globally
- **Keycode Support**: Handle hardware keycodes and character values
- **Multiple Inheritance**: Compose keymaps from multiple parents
- **Translation Fallback**: Automatic fallback (e.g., shift-a to A)
- **Query Bindings**: List all bindings by prefix or command

**Best For:** Text editors, keyboard-driven applications, Emacs-like interfaces, Nyxt browser.

**Note:** BSD 3-Clause by Atlas Engineer LLC. Version 1.1.1. Inspired by Emacsy. Depends on alexandria, fset, trivial-package-local-nicknames, uiop, str.
