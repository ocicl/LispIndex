## black-tie

**System Name:** `black-tie`

**Purpose:** Noise generation library providing Perlin, Simplex, and Voronoi noise algorithms for procedural content generation.

**Why Use It:**
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Perlin, Simplex, and Voronoi noise implementations
- **Dual Implementations**: Both heavily optimized and reference versions available
- **SBCL Optimized**: Performance-tuned for SBCL (portable to other implementations)
- **Texture Generation**: Ideal for creating procedural textures and patterns
- **Simple API**: Straightforward interface for common noise use cases

**Best For:** Game development, procedural terrain generation, texture synthesis, visual effects, or any application requiring coherent noise functions.

**Note:** BSD license. Still in early development with limited algorithm support. Uses safety 0 declarations that should be reviewed. See examples/textures.lisp for usage.
