## cricket

**System Name:** `cricket`

**Purpose:** Comprehensive suite of coherent noise algorithms and composable tools for procedural generation.

**Why Use It:**
- **Extensive Algorithms**: Perlin, Simplex, OpenSimplex, Value, Cellular noise in 1D-4D
- **Fractal Noise**: FBM, Billow, Multifractal, Hybrid Multifractal, Ridged Multifractal
- **Modifiers Pipeline**: 20+ modifiers for transforming and combining noise
- **Image Generation**: Built-in tools for rendering noise to images
- **Parallel Processing**: lparallel support for fast image generation
- **Seedable RNG**: Deterministic, portable noise generation across platforms
- **Arrow Macros**: Clean pipeline syntax for complex noise compositions

**Best For:** Procedural texture generation, terrain generation, game development, creative coding, generative art.

**Note:** MIT licensed. Well-documented with examples. Inspired by libnoise but with many improvements.
