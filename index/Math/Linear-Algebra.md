## magicl

**System Name:** `magicl`

**Purpose:** Matrix Algebra proGrams In Common Lisp - BLAS/LAPACK wrapper with high-level interface.

**Why Use It:**
- **Linear Algebra**: Comprehensive matrix operations
- **BLAS/LAPACK**: Access to optimized Fortran libraries
- **Pure Lisp Fallback**: MAGICL/CORE works without foreign libs
- **Extensions**: BLAS, LAPACK, Expokit backends
- **High-Level API**: MATLAB/NumPy-like interface
- **Backend Control**: Choose Lisp vs accelerated at runtime
- **Portable**: SBCL, CCL, ECL support

**Best For:** Scientific computing, quantum computing, linear algebra, numerical analysis.

**Note:** Created by Rigetti Computing. Fork of CL-BLAPACK with major improvements.
