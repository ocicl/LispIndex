## cl-automaton

**System Name:** `automaton`

**Purpose:** DFA/NFA finite-state automata implementation with Unicode alphabet and regex operations.

**Why Use It:**
- **Unicode Support**: Full Unicode character alphabet for modern text processing
- **Standard Operations**: Concatenation, union, Kleene star regex operations
- **Advanced Operations**: Intersection, complement, and other non-standard automata operations
- **DFA and NFA**: Support for both deterministic and non-deterministic automata
- **Automaton Derivation**: Based on BRICS Automaton Java library

**Best For:** Pattern matching, lexical analysis, compiler construction, text processing, and formal language applications.

**Note:** License unspecified. Depends on rt test framework. More actively maintained version exists in McCLIM's Drei library.
