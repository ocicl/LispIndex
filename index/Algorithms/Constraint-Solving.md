## classowary

**System Name:** `classowary`

**Purpose:** Implementation of the Cassowary linear constraint solver toolkit.

**Why Use It:**
- **Constraint Solving**: Solve systems of linear equality and inequality constraints
- **UI Layouts**: Commonly used for responsive UI layout engines
- **Incremental Updates**: Efficiently update constraints without full re-solve
- **Symbolic Variables**: Work with named variables in constraint expressions
- **MOP Integration**: Uses CLOS and MOP for extensibility

**Best For:** GUI layout systems, responsive design, constraint-based graphics, and applications needing linear constraint solving.

**Note:** zlib license. Repository migrated to Codeberg. Depends on documentation-utils. Based on Greg Badros's Cassowary constraint solver.
