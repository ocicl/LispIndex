## convex-covering

**System Name:** `convex-covering`

**Purpose:** Algorithm for computing convex hull covering set of a mesh.

**Why Use It:**
- **Mesh Decomposition**: Decompose complex meshes into convex hulls
- **Collision Detection**: Generate convex decompositions for physics engines
- **Parallel Processing**: Optional lparallel support for multi-core performance
- **Visualization Tools**: Debug and visualize decomposition results
- **3D Graphics Integration**: Works with 3d-spaces and manifolds libraries

**Best For:** Physics simulation, collision detection, 3D game development, mesh processing.
