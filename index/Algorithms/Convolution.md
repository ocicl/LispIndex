## convolution-kernel

**System Name:** `convolution-kernel`

**Purpose:** Implementation of kernels for convolution-like cellular transformations across grids.

**Why Use It:**
- **Grid Transformations**: Apply convolution operations to tile grids
- **Cellular Automata**: Support for cellular transformation patterns
- **Game Development**: Useful for procedural generation and grid-based effects

**Best For:** Procedural generation, cellular automata, grid-based games, image processing on grids.

**Note:** MIT licensed. Depends on tile-grid and mfiano-utils.
