## cl-editdistance

**System Name:** `edit-distance`

**Purpose:** Compute Levenshtein edit distance between sequences.

**Why Use It:**
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Standard edit distance metric for sequence comparison
- **Operations Tracking**: Get detailed diff with insertion/deletion/match operations
- **Flexible**: Works with any sequence type, custom equality functions supported

**Best For:** String similarity, spell checking, diff generation, fuzzy matching.

## DartsCLSequenceMetrics

**System Name:** `darts.lib.sequence-metrics`

**Purpose:** Distance metrics on sequences and strings.

**Why Use It:**
- **String Distance**: Hamming, Levenshtein, Jaro, Jaro-Winkler
- **Sequence Metrics**: Works on general sequences
- **Substring Matching**: Longest common substring/subsequence
- **N-grams**: N-gram generation and mapping
- **Case Control**: Case-sensitive and case-insensitive options

**Best For:** String matching, fuzzy search, spell checking, data deduplication, similarity.

**Note:** Multiple distance algorithms for strings and sequences.
