## exponential-backoff

**System Name:** `exponential-backoff`

**Purpose:** An implementation of the exponential backoff algorithm.

**Why Use It:**
- **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for retrying failed operations
- **No Dependencies**: Pure Common Lisp implementation
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent overwhelming services with retry requests
- **Network Resilience**: Handle transient network failures gracefully
- **Simple**: Straightforward algorithm implementation

**Best For:** Network applications, API clients, and any code that needs to retry operations with progressively increasing delays.
