## hyperlattices

**System Name:** `hyperlattices`

**Purpose:** Generalized lattice algebraic datatypes including lattice, hyperlattice, probabilistic variants.

**Why Use It:**
- **Lattice Algebra**: Mathematical lattice structures
- **Hyperlattices**: Generalized lattice datatypes
- **Probabilistic**: Probabilistic-lattice and probabilistic-hyperlattice
- **Generic Interface**: Uniform API across lattice types
- **POSET Support**: Partially ordered sets
- **MOP Integration**: Closer-MOP based implementation

**Best For:** Mathematical computing, algebraic structures, formal methods, category theory.
