## cl-fast-ecs

**System Name:** `cl-fast-ecs`

**Purpose:** Entity-Component-System pattern implementation focused on speed and interactive development.

**Why Use It:**
- **GC-Friendly**: Configurable high water mark prevents excessive allocation
- **Interactive Redefinition**: Redefine components and systems on the fly during development
- **Struct-of-Arrays**: Performance-optimized data layout for cache efficiency

**Best For:** Game development, simulations, data-oriented design, processing many entities.

**Note:** MIT License. Alpha quality, API subject to change.

## escalator

**System Name:** `escalator`

**Purpose:** An experimental object system for high-performance games.

**Why Use It:**
- **Entity System**: Component-based entity system architecture
- **Game Performance**: Designed for high-performance game development
- **Minimal Overhead**: Optimized for speed and efficiency
- **Flexible Components**: Modular component-based design

**Best For:** Game development, entity-component-system architectures.

## escalator

**System Name:** `escalator`

**Purpose:** An experimental object system for high-performance games.

**Why Use It:**
- **Entity-Component System**: Entity system architecture for game development
- **Performance**: Designed specifically for high-performance game scenarios
- **Iteration**: Uses iterate for efficient looping
- **Game Architecture**: Alternative to CLOS for game entity management
- **Cache Friendly**: Optimized memory layout for better cache performance
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead for game loop performance

**Best For:** Game developers needing a high-performance entity-component system as an alternative to traditional CLOS for game objects.
