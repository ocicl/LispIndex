## cl-isaac

**System Name:** `cl-isaac`

**Purpose:** Fast cryptographic random number generator (ISAAC-32 and ISAAC-64).

**Why Use It:**
- **Fast CRNG**: Cryptographically strong, very fast RNG
- **ISAAC Algorithm**: Bob Jenkins' ISAAC algorithm implementation
- **32-bit and 64-bit**: Both ISAAC-32 and ISAAC-64 variants
- **Optimized**: Roughly as fast as Jenkins' optimized C code on SBCL
- **Multiple Seeds**: Kernel, CL random, or self-seeding

**Best For:** Applications requiring fast, cryptographically strong random numbers.
