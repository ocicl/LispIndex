## claw-olm

**System Name:** `claw-olm`

**Purpose:** Thin Common Lisp wrapper over OLM cryptographic library for Matrix protocol.

**Why Use It:**
- **Matrix Protocol**: E2E encryption support for Matrix messaging
- **OLM Bindings**: Access to libolm cryptographic ratchet implementation
- **Autowrapping**: Uses claw for automated C binding generation

**Best For:** Matrix client implementations, encrypted messaging applications, and projects requiring OLM/Megolm encryption.

**Note:** License unspecified. Work in progress. Part of claw ecosystem for C library bindings. Requires libolm C library.
